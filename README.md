Local code development by CMENP for JLab

The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) is a DOE national lab located in Newport News, VA.  The main facility is an electron accelerator that ran nuclear/particle experiments with a max. beam energy of 6 GeV (pre-2015) and 12 GeV (post-2015).

The CMENP group is affiliated with Hall B at JLab, that houses the CLAS detector.  The detector was configured differently for each max. beam energy.  At 6 GeV, the detector is refered to as CLAS6.  At 12 GeV, it is CLAS12.  This repository will maintain analysis code for both CLAS6 and CLAS12.  The directory structure will be self-explanatory.
